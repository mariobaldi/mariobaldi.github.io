If you are new to P4 and would like to get an overview of what it is, how it came about, and what its various specification documents cover, you may want to listen to the podcast below in which [Silvano Gai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silvano-gai-15263b1/) interviews me.
The interview closes with a discussion of how [Pensando Systems](http://pensando.io) leverages P4 and is involved in the [P4 Community](http://p4.org).
