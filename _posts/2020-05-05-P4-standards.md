If you are new to P4 and would like to get an overview about what it is, how it came about, and what its various specification documents cover, you may want to listen to the podcast below in which [Silvano Gai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silvano-gai-15263b1/) interviews me.
As a bonus feature, the interview closes with a discussion of why P4 is relevant to [Pensando System](http://pensando.io) and how Pensando is involved in the [P4 Community](http://p4.org).
