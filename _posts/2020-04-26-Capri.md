My friend and colleague at [Pensando](https://pensando.io/) 
Silvano Gai has posted an excellent [video](https://silvanogai.github.io/posts/capri/) 
presenting the  
Capri ASIC that is at the heart of the Pensando 
[Distributed Services Card](https://pensando.io/assets/documents/Naples_100_ProductBrief-10-2019.pdf). 

In a couple of minutes he provides a clear and easy to follow overview of a very powerful and innovative device.

[Enjoy it!}(https://silvanogai.github.io/posts/capri/)
