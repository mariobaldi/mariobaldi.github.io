My friend and [Pensando](https://pensando.io/) colleague [Silvano Gai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silvano-gai-15263b1/) has posted an excellent [video](https://silvanogai.github.io/posts/capri/) presenting the Capri ASIC that is at the heart of the Pensando [Distributed Services Card](https://pensando.io/assets/documents/Naples_100_ProductBrief-10-2019.pdf).

In a couple of minutes he provides a clear and easy to follow overview of a very powerful and innovative device.

[Enjoy it!](https://silvanogai.github.io/posts/capri/)

P.S. Silvano's [blog](https://silvanogai.github.io/) has some very interesting content. You might want to check it out and keep an eye on it!
