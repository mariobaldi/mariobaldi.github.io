I live in the enchanted corner of Cundy's Harbor, ME, that you can see up here and I am a Distinguished Technologist at Pensando Systems, Milpitas, CA, USA and Associate Professor of Information Processing Systems (on leave) at Politecnico di Torino (Technical University of Turin), Italy.
I held various positions in startup and established companies in the computer networking industry, as well as several visiting professorships at Universities in four continents. I have authored over 150 scientific publications and two books; I am an inventor on dozens of patents. Over the years, my research and engineering interests have covered programmable data planes, big data analytics, trust in software execution, internetworking, high performance switching, optical networking, quality of service, multimedia over packet networks, voice over IP, and computer networks in general.
I hold an M.S. with honors (Summa Cum Laude) in Electrical Engineering and a Ph.D. in Computer and Systems Engineering, both from Politecnico di Torino, Italy.

A [full resume](http://resume.baldi.info/) and the complete list of my [publications](http://pubs.baldi.info/) are available on my website at [www.baldi.info](http://baldi.info).
