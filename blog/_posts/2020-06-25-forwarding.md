title:  A chat about forwarding

Techniques and algorithms to forward packets have been a topic of discussion since the eighties. In this podcast, I chat with [Sivano Gai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silvano-gai-15263b1/) about forwarding. Silvano has his own blog at [silvanogai.github.io](https://silvanogai.github.io/)

We informally cover:
* Layer 2 vs. layer 3 forwarding
* ACLs processing
* Binary vs. ternary matches
* Binary hash table forwarding
* Ternary LPM (Longest Prefix Match) forwarding
* Combining forwarding with ACLs
* Flow cache based forwarding
* Forwarding in routers and NICs
* Label-based forwarding
* Segment routing
